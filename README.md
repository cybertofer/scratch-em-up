shoot em up learning you how to scratch

first try and development idea of my scratch em up game.
The main idea is to learn scratching records shooting space tities and sergent gay lama from space.

how it  s work...

so the vinyl movement gives the position of the spaceship.

i also develop a fader capter, when you cut the sound , your spaceship send lazer in the face of ennemies, 
killing them all. a good way to learn scratching :)
