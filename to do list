hey guys, thanks for comming.

there is 2 main things to do. 

1st create a level than a game :)
2nd My way to give the ship position is by a puredata patch i worked on. the best is to incorporate a timecoded analyser 
in the game by it self.

create the game

the way to move the ship is simply by x mouse position in space.
[the x position is given by the needle position on vinyl, analysed by pure data and converted in mouse position]


to begin we just need to animate some ennemies than make the ship moving
